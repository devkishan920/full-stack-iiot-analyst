Makefile is generally used for building and managing dependencies file or projects, not for directly executing shell scripts or creating systems like password authentication. However, you can use a Makefile to invoke a shell script that performs such tasks.
 
 #!/bin/bash
  
 echo -n "Enter the password: "
 read -s pass
 echo
  
 if [ "$pass" == "1234" ]; then
    echo "Access Granted"
 else
    echo "Access Denied"
 fi

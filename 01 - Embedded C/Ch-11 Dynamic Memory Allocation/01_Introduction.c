// In C, a program gets it's memory in a STACK form, where it's all variables are stored.

// Some extra memory can be requested from memory segment called HEAP, i.e., Dynamic Memory.

// Stack get destroyed, once fucntion is returned. While, Heap Area is shared by all Dynamic libraries and is allocated Dynamically

// Dynamic Memory Allocation - Way to allocate, reallocate or free memory to a data structure during the runtime OR Simply saying, Creation of On-Demand Memory in runtime. 

// FUnctions for DMA in C
//  -   malloc()
//  -   calloc()
//  -   free()
//  -   realloc()
